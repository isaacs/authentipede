Yahoo! OS SDK
=============
After downloading and unpackaging the release, copy the contents of yosdk/lib 
to a directory that is accessible via the PHP require/require_once methods. In 
your PHP scripts, require the Yahoo.inc file:

    require("Yahoo.inc");

or

    require_once("Yahoo.inc");

Now you should be ready to instantiate your YahooSession object and get
started.

JSON Libraries
==============
The SDK will use the built-in json_encode/json_decode methods if they're 
available. If they're not available, the SDK will fall back to using the 
PEAR Services_JSON package:

    http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=198

If your PHP install doesn't supply json_encode/json_decode and you don't 
have the PEAR package, the SDK will print an error telling you to get the 
PEAR package and then exit. To install the PEAR package, download the tgz 
file:

    http://mike.teczno.com/JSON.tar.gz

Unzip the file:

    tar xzf JSON.tar.gz

And copy JSON.php to the directory containing Yahoo.inc (supplied by 
the SDK).

Sample Application
==================
In the yosdk/sample directory you'll find sampleapp.php, a sample application 
that will get you started. Put the file in your hosting directory and fill 
in the consumer key, consumer key secret and application ID. When you're done, 
point your browser at the URL. You will be directed to verify access to the 
application and then you will be redirected back to your application.
